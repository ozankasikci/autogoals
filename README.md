# AutoGoals

Autonomous long-term goal execution system for Claude Code.

Define multiple interconnected project goals in YAML, and let Claude Code work autonomously for hours implementing them one by one with interactive planning, autonomous execution, and automated verification.

## Features

- **Multi-goal execution** - Define 10+ goals with dependencies
- **Interactive planning** - Socratic questioning before implementation
- **Autonomous execution** - Hours of work without human intervention
- **Verification gates** - Automated testing with retry logic
- **State persistence** - Resume across sessions
- **Git isolation** - Each goal in separate worktree

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** - Implementation in progress

See `docs/plans/2025-12-07-autogoals-design.md` for complete design specification.

## Quick Start
