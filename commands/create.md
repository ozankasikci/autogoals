description: Interactive wizard for creating goals.yaml files with step-by-step guidance
---

Create a new goals.yaml file through an interactive wizard that guides you through defining your project goals.

The wizard will ask for essential information for each goal:
- Goal ID (unique identifier)
- Display name
- Description (what to build)
- Verification commands (how to verify success)

After creation, the file will be validated and you'll have the option to immediately start goal execution.

Use the goal-creator skill to run the interactive wizard.
